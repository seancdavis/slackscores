Slack Scores
==========

Slack Scores is a Ruby script that reads posts score updates to your Slack channel. It does this by parsing ESPN's scores page(s) and looking for changes in the score of live games.

**This is currently only compatible with English Premier League matches.**

_Documentation coming soon._
